# expressjs-with-mongodb-native-driver

[Mhing](https://github.com/mingbackmountain) who is one of my best friends, really want to know how to implement MongoDB to NodeJS server. So He knew that most products use Mongoose to connect between server and MongoDB. I usually use Mongoose ORM to implement to my NodeJS. But now I think that I don't need to use Mongoose anymore. So I personally suggest Mhing that he should use MongoDB native driver instead. He gets confused how to implement it without callback issue. Finally, I create this basic example to explain it. I hope that this example will help you to get more understanding. It's up to you to use ORM or not.

## Setup

1. You have to start MongoDB server
2. `npm install`
3. `npm dev`
